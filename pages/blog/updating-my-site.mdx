### Note

Although the repository for my website does include a `changelog` that summarizes changes and additions for each update, this post goes into far greater detail regarding update 1.1. The overall format of this post will be similar to that of the `changelog`. 

## Introduction

Often as a developer, I struggle to find motivation or inspiration to start new projects; Sometimes I'll start an exciting new project and make a lot of progress, but suddenly lose motivation or just stop working on it due to a busy schedule, etc. Don't get me wrong, I've explored different ideas and projects, but sometimes it can be difficult to *actually stick with a project and finish it*. So, what's the solution to this problem? Return to an older project and work on it using the knowledge I've gained! This is a great alternative to constantly working on something new and is a good opportunity to view my growth as a developer.

## Changes

### Home Page

First and foremost, I wanted to completely revamp the graphic on the home page. Before the current version, the graphic on the front page was just a sphere of black squares next to (or below, depending on screen width) the main text. I *originally* wanted it to be a slowly rotating sphere that was just in the background, blurred behind the text, but some feedback showed that it was too distracting. So, I moved the graphic to the side, and other than the user being able to move it around with their mouse, it served no purpose; After moving it to the side, it didn't even look good!
<br/>
I wanted to add more interactivity to the graphic on the home page and make it resemble a portfolio project somewhat -- At the bare minimum, I wanted it to do *something*. So I decided to make an interactive 3D directory that would enable the user to navigate to different posts. 
<br/> 
The first step towards achieving this was to replace those boring black squares with something more interesting - I wanted each post to be represented by some sort of 3D shape; I settled on a sort of pyramid (or a cone with only 3 sides.) For a while I wanted them to be solid, but then I tried to give them a wireframe look and I liked it far more. At first, they were just floating in space in a somewhat spherical layout, but I decided it looked too unorganized like that. Instead, I added a line stemming from the origin (0,0,0), to each node, to help give some more shape to the overall graphic. After I spent *way* too much time on the looks of the graphic, I had to actually implement the interactivity. I went back and forth for a while on how to do this and ended up going with a simple implementation. I essentially just made use of the built-in events with R3F components for clicking and hovering; When the user clicks on the node, it would redirect, and when a user hovers, it changes the style of an HTML element to be shown, rather than hidden. My only issue with the redirect functionality is that it doesn't make use of Next's built-in Link, which is fast; Instead, it uses a `router`. Other than that, though, I'm really happy with the overall look of the new graphic.
<br/>
Completely redesigning the home page graphic took a *long time*. It was partially due to my lack of skill with R3F (no thanks to its *horrible* documentation, like holy shit), but more so due to my perfectionism. When it comes to projects like this, I'll spend as much time as it takes to realize what I envision, I.E. I won't settle for anything less than *exactly* what I want. This always leads to the project taking an extremely long time. Anyway, this is a tangential topic and I might write a whole post on it sometime in the future.

### Other changes

The only other major problem I had with the site was various styling issues, with the biggest being margins. Since I initially set margins of every page to be based on `rem`, the margins would be way too big on mobile views, and it would make the text difficult to read. I fixed this by setting the margins to percentages.
I also implemented a library that detects if a user is on a mobile device and then used that to hide the 3d graphic for mobile users. (since mobile users can't really click and drag with a mouse) I also added a small border to the cards for the posts page, just so that it was easier to make out that they were, in fact, cards. From my testing, I couldn't discover any other bugs or anything that bothered me, so that's about all I changed. 

## Additions

To go along with the 3D directory/home page revamp/whatever you want to call it, I added some text to help users understand what it is and how to use it. I also have some plans to add settings for the graphic, like limiting the frame rate and adding an option to see stats, but that's a pretty minor detail. Now that I'm thinking about it, I should probably also add a way to just hide the directory altogether.
<br/>
... Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention I wrote a post about Arch Linux. You can read that [here](/posts/first-linux-experience).

## Why you should work on old projects

Now for the part that applies to you, the reader; Why would *you* want to go back and work on *your* old projects? Well, there are several good reasons!
1. It gives you something to do when you're not working on other projects, or if you lack the motivation to start something new
2. You can see how much you've progressed as a developer
3. You can fix your old mistakes and learn from them!
The list goes on, but you can see just from those examples how beneficial it can be to work on old projects.
<br/> 
Other than this website, here's another example of an old project: my physics engine! A while ago, I decided to test my limited knowledge of physics by designing a physics engine for THREE.js. I didn't make it far with this project and gave up pretty quickly. Recently, however, I had a sudden motivation to try again, so I picked up the project, and I've been having a lot of fun with it. Trust me, once you polish up an old project, you'll appreciate it.

## Conclusion

This is already a pretty long post, so I'll just do a TL:DR

Redid the front page 3d thing, reworked some styling, wrote a new post, added some info on the front page, also it's good to work on old projects, and you should try it sometime.

export default function MDXPage({children}) { return <BlogLayout meta={meta}>{children}</BlogLayout>; }

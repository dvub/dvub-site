## Introduction

Going into writing this post, I didn't have a lot that I knew I wanted to write about; I just knew that I wanted to write *something* about Obsidian and my experience with it; Therefore, this post might be a little disorganized, as I'm just writing to get all of my thoughts out.
<br/>
As always, I'll try to provide links for everything so that you can learn more for yourself (and if you want, try it for yourself! (I'm not sponsored... but HML Obsidian) Enjoy! :)

## What is Obsidian?

If you're reading this post and asking, "How do you have a second brain? And what does it have to do with Obsidian? I thought that was a rock or something??" Calm down, I'll explain everything! [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is, at the most basic level, a text editor; The [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_(software)) describes it as "...a personal knowledge base and note-taking software application that operates on Markdown files." Obsidian gives you a place -- vaults, as they're called -- to store notes/information; Thus, a "second brain." The best part about Obsidian, in my opinion, is its *flexibility*; There's no singular right or wrong way to use it, and you can configure it for whatever workflow is best for *you*. Obsidian also has support for external plugins, which extends the functionality of Obsidian **even more**. So, to answer your questions: No, I don't have 2 brains, and no, I'm not talking about the rock. (I don't care if obsidian isn't technically a rock)

## Why?

The main reason I started using Obsidian was for school. For my whole life, I had taken notes on paper in a notebook. Lately, though, I've wanted to try something different. I'll be entering higher education soon and I wanted to prepare myself for the workflow that comes with it. I also work well with rigid structure (think lists and steps for *everything*) Obsidian just made sense for me.
<br/>
But does Obsidian make sense for you? The answer is *very likely* **yes**.
<br/>
Whether it's for school, work, or daily life, you could use Obsidian for just about anything. 

## Learning Obsidian

### Markdown
Not only is Obsidian applicable to almost anything, but Obsidian is also ridiculously easy to learn how to use. Obsidian uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which is a format for text that generates HTML, while still being easy to read. (Check out the wiki page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)) Markdown is super simple; For example, \*\***this**\*\* is how you make words bold, (with the 2 asterisks surrounding the text), and \**this*\* is italic! pretty neat!! You can define titles of different sizes with hashtags, like this:
#### \#\#\#\# This is a Markdown header!

### The Rest is Easy
This is all tangential to Obsidian, but I'm just trying to demonstrate the simplicity of Markdown. Other than Markdown, Obsidian is pretty simple, providing a file manager, a nice search tool, some good UI options, and *the graph view*. The graph view lets you visualize your notes and their relations to each other, which can be very useful if you reference notes to each other. (I personally don't do this, so I don't use the feature often) If there are features you want that Obsidian doesn't offer, don't worry; If you look around the community plugins for a while, you can probably find a plugin for what you're looking for, created and maintained by the awesome community.

## The Good

I love Obsidian. After using it for a few months, I can confidently say that it has improved my success in school and overall productivity/organization. Everything that I've needed Obisidian to do, it's done in an intuitive and easy way. I've rarely had issues with Obsidian, if at all, and I only have a few complaints with Obsidian. 

## The Bad

As of the time of writing, I can only think of one thing that I *don't* like about Obsidian, which is the sync feature. Obsidian itself is free, but it makes money from Obsidian Sync. Obsidian Sync lets you work on the same vaults and notes across machines, with "end-to-end encryption" and "version history." There's just one problem with this: **You can already do this for free.** One of the most popular plugins on Obsidian is the Obsidian Git Integration plugin, which (if you couldn't guess) provides Git support for Obsidian. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system that lets you manage files and control different versions. [Github](https://github.com/) is a remote hosting service that integrates Git, and allows users to host files and collaborate. (there are some extra features not worth noting for now) With just a little extra work, you could set up Git/Github with Obsidian and get *the same features* that Obsidian Sync offers, *for free*. For users, this isn't bad at all. Actually, It's great because you don't have to pay anything to use Obsidian across devices. For Obsidian, on the other hand, it loses a lot of money.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Obsidian is an amazing piece of productivity software that I would recommend to just about everybody. Regardless of the task, you could probably use Obsidian to help manage it. I can't really think of anything else to write about, so uhhh.... yeah. That's it.

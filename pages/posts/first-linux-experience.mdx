### Note
This is actually not very recent; I *first* started using Linux *months ago* but didn't think to write a blog post about it until now. So here we are.
Also, this is **not** a tutorial for how to install or use Arch. if you're looking for that, you're in the wrong place. *However*, I've tried to provide links for relevant resources if you're interested in learning more about anything I've mentioned in this post. 

## Introduction
Years ago, I got a mid-2011 Macbook Air from a relative who wasn't using it any longer. I used it on and off for a while until I really needed it for school. For quite some time I ran MacOS on it, which was fine -- that is, excluding the fact that the version of MacOS I was on was years old. The biggest issue with this was not being able to run most modern programs, and that the software was pretty slow on such old hardware. So in my mind, there was only one reasonable solution: **Install Linux!** Getting my hands on Linux was something I had an interest in for a long time, but never really had the opportunity to try until recently. Here are the laptop specs, by the way (from running `neofetch`): 
- CPU: Intel i5-2557M ... @ 2.700GHz
- GPU: Intel 2nd Generation Core Process
- Memory: 3832MiB
- Resolution: 1440x900
- Host: MacBookAir4,2 1.0
## Distro Choice
After deciding that I wanted to try Linux, the next step was to choose a distribution to use -- a daunting task. (By the way, there are lots of tools online to help you if you're using Linux: try [distrochooser](https://distrochooser.de/)) I ended up going with [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/). My main considerations were at least a little bit of **simplicity**, since I'm a Linux noob, and also that the distro could run on very **old hardware**. According to the website, Arch is "a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that tries to Keep It Simple." (the KISS ideology, without the stupid at the end!) In retrospect, Arch Linux was probably not the best beginner choice, but I had a lot of fun learning Linux with it regardless. 

### Desktop Environment
The next thing most people consider after their distribution is the [desktop environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment) of choice. Some distributions come with desktop environments set up out of the box, such as [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/), but Arch allows the user to choose any DE they want, providing a lot of flexibility and versatility. I went with [XFCE](https://www.xfce.org/) because I heard pretty good things about it online. XFCE uses the [XFWM](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfwm4/introduction) window manager, which is pretty alright. Lately, though, I've been considering switching WM's to something sleeker.  XFCE also comes with a terminal, file manager, email reader, and all the other good stuff you would expect in a DE. 
### Ricing
One of the other things I wanted to quickly mention in this post was my experience with ricing my system. XFCE is super easy to customize and it took me probably an hour to customize my system. If you're curious, here are my specs from a `neofetch` screenshot.

## Installation
And now, time for my dark confession... I used `archinstall` to install and configure Arch on my laptop. My only excuse is that I spent multiple hours trying to install Arch myself, but ended up having issues along the way. (I honestly forgot what the issues were) *But*, my experience with `archinstall` *does* give me a chance to write about it, as well as the beginner Linux user experience in general. In short, `archinstall` was **incredibly convenient and easy to use** for a noob user. (me) The configuration options were pretty simple to understand and with `archinstall` the process probably took 20 minutes in total. Overall, I would say it was extremely approachable as a complete beginner. I'm sure that if I had dedicated a bit more time and patience to manually installing, I could have gotten it, but I just decided to try `archinstall`. 

## Experience
As for my actual user experience with Arch and Linux in general, well, it's been pretty great! In fact I'm writing this blog post on my laptop right now using Obsidian! (I'll probably be writing about obsidian in a future post since I've started using it so much) Arch is ridiculously lightweight, stable, and fast, and everything runs smoothly.

### Issues
All of the issues I've had relating to Arch have been user error, and almost nothing has *not* been my fault. The first major issue I had after installation was extremely slow internet speeds. After some troubleshooting and research on forums, (Arch forums are pretty helpful) I learned that I was missing networking drivers which were needed for my hardware. To be more specific, I was missing the `broacom-wl` driver. (broadcom sucks btw) As for *why* I was missing the drivers, this was due to my improper configuration of `archinstall`; I can't remember if this networking driver was presented as an option, but at the very least, it was not the fault of Arch itself.
<br/>...<br/>
The next major issue I had was a graphics issue; Using any applications with hardware acceleration would cause graphical glitches like flickering black boxes on the screen. For a long time, I just dealt with it and disabled hardware acceleration on all of my applications, since I thought it was an issue with my old hardware. At this point, I can't say exactly what happened; After a certain point, the issue just *went away*. This could be due to certain packages or drivers being replaced, or any number of reasons. Again, likely not the fault of arch.
<br/>...<br/>
The next, and most recent issue I had was yet again an issue caused by my use of `archinstall`. I only allocated about 20gb to the partition which would contain packages, etc. This wasn't an issue until I ran out of space (obviously) and could no longer update my system. The process to resize partitions -- without simply deleting them -- was not very simple. To summarize, I had to flash a live version of `gparted` onto a USB drive, boot from the USB drive, and use that to resize the partitions. Now that I'm describing it, it doesn't seem that complicated, but since I had never done anything like it I was very intimidated.

## Conclusion
So, what are the takeaways here? Arch is a great distro, but **not for beginners** -- or more specifically, not for beginners who don't have *hours* to spend researching and learning. If you're looking to get into Arch and *do* have hours to learn and spend time researching, then by all means, try Arch! Other than that, though, Arch and Linux in general has been a great experience, and I don't really have any complaints!

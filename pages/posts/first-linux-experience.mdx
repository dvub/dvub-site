### Note
This is actually not very recent; I actually *first* started using Linux *months ago*, but didn't think to write a blog post about it until now. So here we are.
Also, this is absolutely not a tutorial for how to install or use arch. if you're looking for that, you're in the wrong place. *However*, I've tried to provide links for relevant resources if you're interested in learning more about anything I've mentioned in this post. 

# Introduction
Years ago, I got a mid-2011 Macbook Air from a relative who wasn't using it any longer. I used it on and off for a while, until I actually needed it for school. For quite some time I ran MacOS on it, which was fine -- that is, excluding the fact that the version of MacOS I was on was years old. The biggest issue with this was not being able to run most modern programs, and that the software was pretty slow on such old hardware. So in my mind, there was only one reasonable solution: **Install Linux!** Getting my hands on Linux was something I had had interest in for a long time, but never really had the opportunity to actually try until recently. Here are the laptop specs, by the way (from running `neofetch`): 
- CPU: Intel i5-2557M (4) @ 2.700GHz
- GPU: Intel 2nd Generation Core Process
- Memory: 3832MiB
- Resolution: 1440x900
- Host: MacBookAir4,2 1.0
# Distro Choice
After deciding that I wanted to try Linux, the next step was to choose a distribution to use -- a daunting task. (By the way, there are lots of tools online to help you if you're using linux: try [distrochooser](https://distrochooser.de/)) I ended up going with [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).My main considerations were at least a little bit of **simplicity**, since I'm a Linux noob, and also that the distro could run on very **old hardware**. According to the website, Arch is "a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that tries to Keep It Simple." (the KISS ideology, without the stupid at the end!) In retrospect, Arch Linux was probably not the best beginner choice, but I had a lot of fun learning Linux with it regardless. 

## Desktop Environment
The next thing most people consider after their distribution is the [desktop environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment) of choice. Some distributions come with desktop environments set up out of the box, such as [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/), but Arch allows the user to choose any DE they want, providing a lot of flexibility and versatility. I went with [XFCE](https://www.xfce.org/) because I heard pretty good things about it online. XFCE uses the [XFWM](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfwm4/introduction) window manager, which is pretty alright. Lately though, I've been considering switching WM's to something more sleek.  XFCE also comes with a terminal, file manager, email reader, and all the other good stuff you would expect in a DE. 
## Ricing
One of the other things I wanted to quickly mention in this post was my experience with ricing my system. XFCE is super easy to customize and it took me probably an hour to customize my system. If you're curious, here are my specs from a `neofetch` screenshot. You can also see the rice from the screenshot lol...

# Installation
And now, time for my dark confession.. I used `archinstall` to install and configure Arch on my laptop. My only excuse is that I spent multiple hours trying to install Arch myself, but ended up having issues along the way. (I honestly forgot what the issues were) *But*, my experience with `archinstall` *does* give me a chance to write about it, as well as the beginner Linux user experience in general. In short, `archinstall` was **incredibly convenient and easy to use** for a noob user. (me) The configuration options were pretty simple to understand and with `archinstall` the process probably took 20 minutes in total. Overall, I would say it was extremely approachable as a complete beginner. I'm sure that if I had dedicated a bit more time and patience to manually installing, I could have gotten it, but I just decided to try `archinstall`. 

# Experience
As for my actual user experience with Arch and Linux in general, well, it's been pretty great! In fact, I'm writing this blog post on my laptop right now using Obsidian! (I'll probably be writing about obsidian in a future post since I've started using it so much) Arch is ridiculously lightweight and fast, and everything runs smoothly except for certain programs such as VSCode. (due to all of the extensions I use) I've had *very* few issues (which I'll discuss in the next section of the post). XFCE as a desktop environment has been

## Introduction

First, a warning: If you (for some inexplicable reason) are an absolute Windows lover, this blog post *will* contain **Windows hate**. This blog post *also* contains a lot of my opinions on operating systems; Feel free to do whatever you want with your computer and take everything I write about with a grain of salt. 
<br/>
Second, a note (and a bit of a confession): I didn't actually fully switch to Linux; I went with a dual boot setup with Windows 10 and Arch Linux. This is because there are certain applications I use that only run on Windows, and don't really work with compatibility layers like Wine, etc. Also, since I'm on my daily driver I wanted to keep Windows as a backup so that I would have something to use in case I messed up my Linux system badly. 
<br/>
Anyway, I'm writing this blog post because I *finally* switched to Linux on my daily driver, my desktop PC. After I switched on my laptop (I wrote a post about that too!) I realized I *had* to switch on my daily driver too; It was only a matter of time at that point. I want to write about my own experience dual booting Linux and Windows, and hopefully convince you to get rid of Windows and use Linux too.

## Introduction

First, a warning: If you (for some inexplicable reason) are an absolute Windows lover, this blog post *will* contain **Windows hate**. This blog post *also* contains a lot of my opinions on operating systems; Feel free to do whatever you want with your computer and take everything I write about with a grain of salt. 
<br/>
Second, a note (and a bit of a confession): I didn't actually fully switch to Linux; I went with a dual boot setup with Windows 10 and Arch Linux. This is because there are certain applications I use that only run on Windows, and don't really work with compatibility layers like wine, etc. Also, since I'm on my daily driver, I wanted to keep Windows as a backup so that I would have something to use in case I messed up my Linux system badly. 
<br/>
Anyway, I'm writing this blog post because I *finally* switched to Linux on my daily driver PC. After I switched on my laptop (I wrote a post about that too!) I realized I *had* to switch on my daily driver too; It was only a matter of time at that point. I want to write about my own experience dual booting Linux and Windows, and hopefully convince you to get rid of Windows and use Linux too. 

# Why

Why should you switch to Linux? There are many reasons, but their relevance to you will depend based on your needs and usage. The first few reasons apply to most, though:
- Privacy
	- Some time ago, I watched a fascinating [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT4vDfA_4NI) about Windows in its current state; I highly recommend that you watch it too. In summary, the video uses a tool to detect all the internet connections being made to a brand-new Windows 11 machine, compared to those being made to a machine running Windows XP. (ancient, but a surprisingly good benchmark for privacy) The results were that the Windows 11 machine was sending heaps of user data to third-party analytics services without any user interaction -- or user consent. This alone reveals how intrusive Windows has become in terms of user privacy. 
	- Linux, on the other hand, is orders of magnitude more private. Most distros offer amazing privacy and user control, and from my experience, most Linux programs and apps are more private than their Windows counterparts.  Bottom line: **Linux beats Windows in privacy, in every way.** 
- Efficiency
	- 
- Security
- FOSS

### Note

Although the repository for my personal website does include a `changelog` which summarizes changes and additions for each update, this post goes into far greater detail regarding update 1.1. The overall format of this post will be similar to that of the `changelog`. 

## Introduction

Often as a developer, I struggle to find motivation or inspiration to start new projects; Sometimes I'll start an exciting new project and make a lot of progress, but suddenly lose motivation or just stop working on it due to busy schedule, etc. Don't get me wrong, I've explored different ideas and projects, but sometimes it can be difficult to *actually stick with a project and finish it*. So, what's the solution to this problem? Return to an older project and work on it using the knowledge I've gained! This is a great alternative to constantly working on something new and is a good opportunity to view my growth as a developer.

## Introduction
Often as a developer, I struggle to find motivation or inspiration to start new projects. Don't get me wrong, I've explored different ideas and projects, but sometimes it can be difficult to *actually stick with a project and finish it*. So, what's the solution to this problem? Return to an older project and work on it using the knowledge I've gained! This is a great alternative to constantly working on something new and is a good opportunity to view my own growth!

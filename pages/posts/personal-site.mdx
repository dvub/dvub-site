# Introduction

I decided that it was finally time for me to make my own personal website, for a couple of reasons, but most importantly -- to track my progress as a developer! I considered a few different ways to do this, and maybe I will make use of a few different ways to track my progress, but for now I settled on what you're reading right now -- a blog/post. I'll discuss the tools I used to build the site, and also how you could build your own website, just like this.

# Language

Almost all modern websites on the internet are built with Javascript (approximately 98%, according to [this source](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cp-javascript#:~:text=JavaScript%20is%20used%20as%20client,98.0%25%20of%20all%20the%20websites.)) Javascript is nice, but in my opinion, is missing a few key features that a language should have. That's where Typescript comes in: a superset of Javascript with type support!

```js
const abcd = "2001";
```

export default ({children}) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>

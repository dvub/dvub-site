## Introduction

Going into writing this post, I didn't have a lot of that I knew I wanted to write about; I just knew that I wanted to write *something* about Obsidian and my experience with it. Therefore, this post might be a little disorganized, as I'm just writing to get all of my thoughts out.
<br/>
As always, I'll try to provide links for everything I write about so that you can learn more for yourself (and if you want, try it for yourself! (I'm not sponsored btw... but HML obsidian)) Enjoy! :)

## What is Obsidian?

If you're reading this post and asking, "How the hell do you have a second brain? And what does it have to do with Obsidian? I thought that was a rock or something??" Calm down, I'll explain everything! [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is, at the most basic level, a really fancy text editor; The [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_(software)) describes it as "...a personal knowledge base and note-taking software application that operates on Markdown files." Obsidian gives you a place -- vaults, as they're called -- to store any notes or information you want; Thus, a "second brain." The best part about Obsidian, in my opinion, is its *flexibility*; There's no singular right or wrong way to use it, and you can configure it for whatever workflow is best for *you*. Obsidian also has support for external plugins, which extends the functionality of Obsidian **even more**. So, to answer your questions: No, I don't have 2 brains, and no, I'm not talking about the rock. (I don't care if obsidian isn't technically a rock)

## Why?

Simply asking "why?" is a pretty generic question, so I'll aim to answer why *I* started using it, as well as why *you* should start using it, too. The main reason I started using Obsidian was for school. For basically all of my academic life, I had taken notes on plain ol' paper. This year, though, I wanted to try something different. I'll be entering higher education soon, and I wanted to prepare myself for the workflow that comes with it. I also really like strict organization (lists and steps for *everything*, etc.), and the difficulty of school this year kind of necessitated me being more organized.
<br/>Obsidian just made sense for me.<br/>
But does Obsidian make sense for you? The answer is *very likely* **yes**.

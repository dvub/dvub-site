          Overview
        </h2>
        <p>
          My name is dvub. I am a student currently studying computer science.
          I build some projects for school, but most of the time I build projects for fun. (like this website.) <br />
          Coding is one of my passions, not only as a hobby, but as a way to make change in the world.
          I believe computer science is essential to making change and making it a better place.

          Background
        </h2>
        <p>
          For most of my life, I was interested in technology. I always messed around with old hardware and was fascinated by it.
          When I was younger I discovered Scratch, a simple, block-based programming language. I loved to build games and projects
          of different sorts, and was fascinated and amazed by what people could do with such a tool. I then started really programming
          because I wanted to write mods for the popular game, Terraria. From there, my passion for programming sparked, and now I hope to be
          a professional developer someday.

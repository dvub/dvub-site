# dvub (My personal Website)
### Description
This repository is for my personal website, which serves not only as a portfolio, but also as a way to keep track of my progress as a developer. For the project, I used typescript and nextjs.

If you have bugs, issues, improvements, suggestions, etc. please open an issue and I will look into it. I hope to maintain this project for quite a while and am always looking for ways to improve the site. 

Thanks!
